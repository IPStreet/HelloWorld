# "Hello, IP Street!"
This repo contains "Hello, World!" examples of how to interact with the [IP Street](http://www.ipstreet.com/) suite of API Services.

Each example requires no inputs and will pretty print the API call response to the console when called.  

For full documentation on the IP Street APIs, head over to [docs.ipstreet.com](http://docs.ipstreet.com/).

# "Hello, IP Street!"
This repo contains "Hello, World!" examples of how to interact with the [IP Street](http://www.ipstreet.com/) suite of API Services.

Each example requires no inputs and will pretty print the API call response to the console when called. 

Our sandbox endpoint is used in each example and returns limited but well-formatted results.  Adapting these examples for use with the live endpoints requires removing `/sandbox/` from the the target endpoint and replaceing the sandbox API key with a valid live API Key.  A live API key can be acquired by signing up for access [here](http://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/2051540/9565e3c0-a11d-452d-ae77-fc2b5259ee85).    

For full documentation on the IP Street APIs, head over to our Developer Hub at [docs.ipstreet.com](http://docs.ipstreet.com/).

If you are having trouble working with our APIs, please reach out to us at [support@ipstreet.com](mailto:support@ipstreet.com).  We are always happy to help.
